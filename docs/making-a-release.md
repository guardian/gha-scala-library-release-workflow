# Making a Release

Once a project has been [configured](configuration.md) to use `gha-scala-library-release-workflow`,
a release can be performed by any GitHub user with `write` access to the repo, simply by triggering
the release workflow.

Here's a video of that in action _(full-screen the video to see all details)_:

## Walkthrough of steps

* Click on the `Actions` tab in your repo:<br>

* Select the `Release` workflow from the list of workflows on the left-hand side of the page:<br>

* Click on `Run workflow` on the right-hand side of the blue _"This workflow has a workflow_dispatch event trigger."_ bar:<br>

* You've started a release! However, the GitHub UI doesn't automatically update, so **reload** the page, and then click on
  the new workflow run to see its progress:<br>

### Why can't releases be triggered in another way?

One potentially elegant alternative way to trigger a release would be trigger the workflow when a
[GitHub Release](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository)
is manually created by a developer.

Unfortunately that would require a Git release version tag to be previously created by the developer, and a
primary motivation of `gha-scala-library-release-workflow` is to avoid humans choosing release version numbers - because
humans are terrible at judging compatibility, and thus knowing what the correct
[semver version bump](https://www.scala-lang.org/blog/2021/02/16/preventing-version-conflicts-with-versionscheme.html#early-semver-and-sbt-version-policy)
should be.

If a human has manually chosen a version number before automated workflow occurs, we've already lost. Better to let the
workflow make automatic compatibility-based checks, and derive the new version number (and release tag) for itself.

The `gha-scala-library-release-workflow` automatically creates a GitHub Release, with automatically-generated release
notes, as part of the release process, so a GitHub Release is still created with each release.

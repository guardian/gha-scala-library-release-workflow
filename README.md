This workflow is ideal if your organisation has lots of developers who want an easy, secure, low-config way
to publish releases of Scala libraries!

See the docs for information on:

* [**Configuration**](docs/configuration.md) - Start here to set up a repo use `gha-scala-library-release-workflow`!
* [**Credentials**](docs/credentials/supplying-credentials.md) - how to grant a new repo access to the release credentials
* [**Making a Release**](docs/making-a-release.md) - how to trigger the workflow to publish a new release
* [**Security Design**](docs/security-design.md) - how the workflow keeps your release
  credentials isolated from potentially dangerous code in your library's dependencies
